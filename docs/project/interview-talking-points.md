# Interview Talking Points

## Architecture Questions

**Q: Why two frontends?**  
**A:** "I wanted to demonstrate framework-agnostic API design and compare Angular vs React approaches. It shows I can work in any stack and understand architectural principles beyond specific frameworks."

## Technical Decisions

**Q: Why NestJS?**  
**A:** "Coming from Angular, NestJS felt natural with its similar patterns. It's TypeScript-first, has excellent Swagger integration for API documentation, and follows enterprise best practices."

**Q: Why Nx monorepo?**  
**A:** "Nx allowed me to share TypeScript types between all three apps, reducing duplication. The smart caching speeds up builds, and I can run all apps with one command."

## Learning Journey

**Q: What was hardest to learn?**  
**A:** "The mental shift from Angular's services and observables to React's hooks and component model. Also, understanding when to use Server vs Client Components in Next.js."

## What You'd Do Differently

**Q: What would you improve?**  
**A:** "Add real-time features with WebSockets, implement proper payment integration, add more comprehensive testing, and consider tRPC for even better type safety."
