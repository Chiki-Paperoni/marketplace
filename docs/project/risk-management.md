# Risk Management

## Potential Risks & Mitigation

1. **Learning Curve Too Steep**
   - **Risk:** Can't learn React/Next.js fast enough
   - **Mitigation:** Dedicate time to learning, use official docs

2. **Scope Creep**
   - **Risk:** Adding too many features, losing focus
   - **Mitigation:** Stick to plan, mark optional features clearly

3. **Technical Blockers**
   - **Risk:** Get stuck on complex features
   - **Mitigation:** Ask for help (forums, Discord), simplify if needed

4. **Deployment Issues**
   - **Risk:** Production environment differs from dev
   - **Mitigation:** Deploy early, test often
