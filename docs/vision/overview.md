# Project Vision

## Overview

A production-grade multi-vendor e-commerce marketplace that demonstrates modern full-stack development practices, framework-agnostic architecture, and enterprise-level code quality. The project showcases the ability to build the same application using two different frontend frameworks (Angular & Next.js) while maintaining a single, robust backend API.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Dual Frontend Architecture**: Same backend powering both Angular and Next.js frontends
2. **Framework Agnostic Design**: RESTful API that works with any client
3. **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with auto-generated API clients
4. **Modern Tech Stack**: Latest versions of Angular 17+, Next.js 14+, NestJS
5. **Professional Setup**: Nx monorepo, pnpm workspace, proper CI/CD ready

## Learning Objectives

- Master Next.js and React ecosystem
- Understand differences between Angular and React approaches
- Build scalable REST APIs with NestJS
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Create production-ready applications
